# Travel Destination Recommender System

The **Travel Destination Recommender System** is a Python-based tool designed to provide personalised travel suggestions. By leveraging vector similarity search with cosine similarity, the system matches user preferences to suitable travel destinations. The aim is to enhance the travel planning experience by delivering tailored recommendations based on user-specific criteria, such as budget, weather, and preferred activities.

## Features

- **Custom Vector Database**: Stores travel destinations as vectors.
- **User Preferences Matching**: Converts user input into vectors and matches them with stored destinations.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Efficiently calculates similarity between user preferences and destination data.
- **Flexible Recommendations**: Allows for configurable numbers of suggestions (`top_k`).
